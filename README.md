# Crypto Market RSI Heatmap 📊

This is a simple Python script that generates a RSI heatmap for the top 100 cryptocurrencies by volume using the style of [Coinglass](https://www.coinglass.com/pro/i/RsiHeatMap). The heatmap can be used to identify overbought and oversold conditions in the market.

## Introduction

I have previously recreated this chart for my [fintwit-bot](https://github.com/StephanAkkerman/fintwit-bot), unfortunately coinglass removed their API so I had to recreate it using other sources. I used the chart found on [Coinglass](https://www.coinglass.com/pro/i/RsiHeatMap) as a reference. The data is fetched using [Coingecko's API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api) to get the top volume coins and combined with [TradingView's API](https://github.com/AnalyzerREST/python-tradingview-ta) to get the RSI values.
